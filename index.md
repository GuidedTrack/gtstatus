*Here you can find out what's up with GuidedTrack. We aim to post an update
within fifteen minutes after the start of an incident. Please forgive us when
the wording is rough. We try not to panic, but when the machines go wild, we
don't have time polish our prose. If you have questions or comments, we invite
you to [join the GuidedTrack community
Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/guidedtrackworkspace/shared_invite/zt-1h6ft5ih3-caMIZqn6aEqJN1LZvqGaoA)
or email us at <hello@guidedtrack.com>.*

The servers are running fine.

We're planning to change how much resources are allocated to the site between
06:00 and 07:00 UTC. If you notice anything more than a few glitches, please let
us know. Of course, we'll be watching the site's performance, too.
